			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Dance</h1>
			<p>In Dance, students explore movement as a means of expression in performance. Dance is designed to provide students with the opportunities to gain experience in standard dance techniques, choreography and dance appreciation. Prior experience in dance is helpful but not essential, as creative use of movement is a significant focus. In Year 8 students will begin to develop skills in choreography, using historical and contemporary issues as stimuli. The importance of safe dance practices and nutrition will be discussed.</p>
