			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Dance</h1>
			<p>In Dance, students explore movement as a means of expression in performance. Dance is designed to provide students with the opportunities to gain experience in standard dance techniques, choreography and dance appreciation. Prior experience in dance is helpful but not essential, as creative use of movement is a significant focus. In Years 9 and 10 students continue to study choreography and how dance makers use their movement to express meaning. Co-ordination, flexibility, balance and stamina will be developed through intensive dance practice.</p> 
			<p>It is recommended that students taking this course in Year 9 or 10 must have satisfactorily completed Dance in Year 8.</p>
