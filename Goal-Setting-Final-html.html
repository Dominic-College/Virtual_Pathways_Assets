<br />
The effectiveness of an education program for each student can be improved when appropriate goals are set in place by students with their teachers, and if possible, parents. There are a multitude of benefits that exist for students when specific learning goals are set. <br />
<br />
When students learn and practise how to set and achieve goals, especially with their school work, they learn how to take more ownership of their education. They learn how they play a significant role in their own education and in their future. <br />
<br />
By learning how to set and achieve goals, how to overcome challenges, the importance of being positive, and how to measure their progress, students learn how to enhance and increase their chances for success.<br />
<br />
Successful people have one quality in common and that is the habit of goal setting. If students are taught to set goals during their schooling, they will learn to set goals, pertaining to their career and personal life. Goal setting for students aims to inculcate self-esteem, discipline, focus, concentration, dedication and hard work. <br />
<br />
The purpose of establishing a goal setting framework and process at Dominic College, is to establish an explicit way to help students succeed in school and in life. The process links into the Empower Program where students learn:  to identify and overcome potential roadblocks; to stay focused and positive; the importance of learning from their mistakes; and learn how to breakdown big projects into small doable parts. <br />
<br />
The objectives of the Dominic College Goal Setting Process are to: <br />
<br />
•	Help students take responsibility for their academic and personal development; <br />
<br />
•	Enable students to set priorities in the areas they wish to achieve or improve; <br />
<br />
•	Assist students to plan to achieve their aims;  <br />
<br />
•	Help students to identify potential roadblocks they may encounter in reaching their goals and how to overcome them; and <br />
<br />
•	Support students to have determination and learn how to act on their dreams.<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>Academic Goals</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
Academic goals will be the area where most students should focus their goals. In this area students can identify areas they wish to change or improve in their learning and how to manage their life so they can optimize their learning.<br />
<br />
Academic goals will emerge from students considering their strengths and areas of development. The most recent academic progress report can provide the basis for student and teacher reflection. Goals associated with diligence, work standards and completion and quality of work are the kinds of goals students might identify. Time management, schoolwork and life balance may often be an area for student goal setting <br />
<br />
Students can be encouraged to further extend themselves in areas of strength and teachers can support them to consider goals that further enrich and challenge themselves. <br />
<br />
In identifying areas of improvement, areas such as attendance, punctuality, organisation, personal appearance and support of the College values and rules will be areas that some students should be encouraged to set goals. <br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>Personal Goals</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
After reflection on their academic goals, students are encouraged to set personal goals. Students could write goals that deal with their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual capabilities. Their personal goals will alter something about themselves.<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>Examples of personal goals are:</strong><br />
<h2>
<br />
<strong>Physical</strong> - Plan daily exercise routines, plan for making better food choices, pack their lunch each morning, take up a sport.  Physical goals have to do with altering the physical body for improved health. <br />
<br />
<strong>Mental</strong> – Plan to spend 30 minutes a day reading a book, work on projects on the first day they are assigned, learn a new language or take up some mindfulness activities such as a gratitude journal. Mental goals have to do with challenging the brain and reducing stress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Emotional</strong> – Commit to walk away from a fight, choose not to participate in put downs, refrain from using inappropriate words. Emotional goals have to do with gaining control of emotions and self-awareness. <br />
<br />
<strong>Spiritual</strong> - Take time to reflect on choices every week, read a page from the bible or other religious books, take 5 minutes a day to sit in a quiet space and pray or reflect. Spiritual goals are taking time to quiet the mind and body to be in the moment.<br />
<br />

<strong>Goal Setting at Dominic College</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
At Dominic College we are a community of learners. An important aspect of learning is goal setting. Research has demonstrated that students who set goals and work toward goal achievement are more successful in all areas of their lives. In light of this we have developed a framework for goal setting for the College. <br />
<br />
Students at the College will set goals each term and reflect on their progress. <br />
<br />
A good way to think about Goal setting is using the SMART acronym.<br />

<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>Are your goals S.M.A.R.T. ones?</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<br />
<h2>
<strong>SPECIFIC</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
What exactly will you accomplish? To what standard?<br />
<br />
Performance objectives are generally phrased using action words.<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>MEASURABLE</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
Watch for words that can be misinterpreted such as:<br />
<br />
•	improve, increase, reduce - By how much?<br />
<br />
If you include them, also include how they will be measured.<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>ACHIEVABLE</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
Are 'expected' outcomes able to be completed:<br />
<br />
•	within the given timeframe?<br />
•	with the current resources?<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>RELEVANT</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
Are the objectives related to and relevant to me?<br />
Are the objectives related to what is expected of my year level?<br />
<br />
<h2>
<strong>TIMELY</strong><br />
</h2>
<br />
When should the goal/objective be completed?<br />
<br />
•	Establishing deadlines helps the student and the teacher track the progress of achieving objectives. It helps with ongoing discussions and progress.
