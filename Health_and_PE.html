The areas of study include holistic health education, relationship education, nutrition and drug education, risk taking and decision making, mental health education and sports skills and fitness development.</p>
			<p>Those classes involving practical activities are usually held outdoors, at off-site venues or in the Savio Centre. Year 7 to 10 Health and Physical Education is a core subject and is therefore compulsory for all students.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Outdoor Education</h1>
			<p>The focus of this subject encompasses learning about self, others and the environment through a variety of theoretical, practical and experimental learning activities. Outdoor Education provides a context for students to develop self-reliance, interdependence and leadership in outdoor and natural environments. Students are also given the opportunity to explore and develop an understanding of human-nature relationships in theory and through self-reflection. Students are engaged in outdoor and adventure activities that promote the development of an adventurous spirit with an emphasis on managing self-risk, conducting safe journeys in nature and learning the value of life-long outdoor recreation for enjoyment, health and well-being. Aspects of this course are inherently physically challenging and include exposure to the elements. Some activities are in an aquatic environment so it is advantageous if students have strong aquatic confidence.</p> 
			<p>There will also be a compulsory camp and some basic outdoor clothing will be required by students. This includes warm insulating layers such as thermal and fleece garments, a waterproof coat with hood and sturdy durable footwear.</p>
