			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Humanities Faculty Elective Information</h1>
			<p>Humanities subjects communicate the knowledge and ideas which guide students in making sense of their own lives and the world around them. These subjects focus on developing students’ abilities to participate meaningfully in shaping the community as future citizens. Humanities subjects provide fundamental and essential skills for both the workplace and for tertiary studies.</p>
			<p>The Australian Curriculum provides that History is a compulsory subject from Year 7-10 and that Geography is a compulsory subject from Year 7-8. To satisfy this requirement students study a combined subject called Humanities in Year 7-8 that covers both subject areas and History in Years 9 and 10. Geography is offered as an elective choice in Year 9 or 10. Humanities introduces students to the study of culture, society and the wide-ranging experiences of the peoples of the world over time. In addition, students will continue to learn about the geography of the earth and the impact human activity has on the natural environment.</p>
			<p>Humanities provides students with a context for their lives and with the ability to make informed decisions as future citizens. Students learn vital skills for further studies in a range of subjects.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Geography</h1>
			<p>Geography is the investigation and understanding of the earth and its features and the distribution of life on earth, including human life and its impacts. It is the study of the many different ‘places’, or environments, which make up our world and is described as ‘the why of where’. Places are specific areas of the Earth’s surface, and can range from a locality to a country to a major world region. Geography answers our questions about why places have their particular environmental and human characteristics; how and why these characteristics vary from place to place; how places are connected, and how and why they are changing. This is a one year course that can be studied in either Year 9 or Year 10.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Commerce</h1>
			<p>Commerce provides the knowledge, skills, understanding and values that form the foundation on which young people make sound decisions on consumer, financial, business, legal and employment issues. It develops in students an understanding of commercial and legal processes and competencies for personal financial management. Through the study of Commerce students develop financial literacy which enables them to participate in the financial system in an informed way. Commerce is important because it expands students’ knowledge and understanding of their own society, other societies, local and global communities and the relationship between them. This is a one year course that can be studied in either Year 9 or Year 10.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Introduction to Psychology and Sociology</h1>
			<p>Sociology begins with organising ideas that help us make sense of all the information we have about patterns of behaviour in contemporary Australian society. These theories enable us to understand and explain the nature of the social world. Psychology is the scientific study of human behaviour. Its goals are to describe, understand, predict and control behaviour. Whenever possible psychologists seek empirical evidence (objective and observable) based on scientific observation. This is a one year course that can be studied in either Year 9 or Year 10.</p>
