			<p>Students undertake an intensive introductory course in Japanese in Year 7 and can choose to continue their language studies in Years 8, 9 and 10.</p>
			<p>Learning Japanese enables students to explore one of the worldâ€™s oldest and richest civilisations. Japanese culture influences many areas of contemporary Australian society, including the arts, design, technology, fashion, popular culture and cuisine. Japan has been a close strategic and economic partner of Australia for more than 50 years, and there is ongoing exchange between the two countries in the areas of education, trade, diplomacy and tourism. Japan is an important nation within Asia and a significant contributor to economic, political and diplomatic relations in the region.</p>
			<p>LOTE studies lead to many opportunities beyond school, including employment, travel and community involvement. Students who continue their language studies may have an opportunity to travel on a study tour to further complement their language skills.</p>
