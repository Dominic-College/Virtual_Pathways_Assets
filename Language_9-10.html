			<p>Learning a language(s) broadens studentsâ€™ horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures.</p>
			<p>Learning languages lead to many opportunities beyond school, including employment, travel and community involvement. Students who continue their language studies may have an opportunity to travel on a study tour to further complement their language skills.</p>
