			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Mathematics Faculty Elective Information</h1>
			<p>Understanding mathematics is essential as it is used on a daily basis in our personal and professional lives. Through explanation, real life applications and practice, students acquire knowledge, understanding and skills in mathematics and numeracy which will be required in their everyday lives. Problem solving activities designed to encourage students to think for themselves and to reason are priorities.</p>
			<p>Students may participate in a variety of competitions such as the Australian Mathematics Competitions, MAT enrichment programs and external Maths relays. Dominic Maths Week is also celebrated in November as a chance for every student to get involved in mathematical competitions.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Mathematics Extension</h1>
			<p>This course is available to high achieving students studying mathematics at an advanced level, as an enrichment and extension subject. Through a variety of intellectually challenging situations, students will gain insight into mathematical structures and techniques. This will help students transition into Maths 10A Plus or Mathematics Methods – Foundation. Students considering studying Maths 10A Plus in Year 10 should choose this course in Year 9 as a pre-requisite.</p> 
			<p>Pre-requisite: An ‘A’ in Algebra in the previous year’s course, or an interview with the Head of Mathematics.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Essential Maths</h1>
			<p>Essential Maths is designed for students who require a structured and tightly focused course to develop their numeracy skills to a standard expected by workplace employers and for everyday adult mathematics.</p> 
			<p>The course will be delivered in a multitude of ways and lends itself to teaching and learning, set in contexts other than the traditional Maths classroom. Students will develop and demonstrate numeric competency while working on tasks other than traditional Maths exercises. Examples of settings for such tasks might be project-based learning, investigations, practical tasks, presentations, or a journal of numeracy.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Maths 10A Plus</h1>
			<p>This is the first of a sequence of three courses designed for students intending to study courses at tertiary level which require a strong background in Mathematics, such as Mathematics, Engineering, Physical Sciences, Actuarial Studies, and Statistics. Successfully completing Maths 10A Plus at Dominic College, would then allow students to study Mathematics Methods – Foundation (Level 3) or Mathematics Methods (Level 4) in Year 11. If Mathematics Methods (Level 4) is studied in Year 11, and if the student wanted to proceed to the highest pre-tertiary level in Mathematics, they could study Mathematics Specialised (Level 4) in Year 12. Students will follow the syllabus outlined in the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics 10A document as well as an additional calculus unit. This is an academically demanding course for the most able of Mathematics students, and requires application well beyond what is expected in Core Mathematics.

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">General Maths Preparatory Course</h1>
			<p>This course aims to provide students with an opportunity to be exposed to elements of the Senior General Mathematics Level 3 course that is offered in College. Students in this course will study various topics that are not offered in the 7 – 10 Australian Curriculum: Mathematics, but which are a part of the General Mathematics course. This will then provide them with a solid foundation leading into General Mathematics Level 3.</p>
