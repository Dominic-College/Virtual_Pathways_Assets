			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Science Faculty Elective Information</h1>
			<p>In the words of Albert Einstein, ‘The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To think of new questions, new possibilities and to regard old problems from a different angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances.’</p>
			<p>Science is not just about learning a list of facts or understanding principles. Every child is a scientist from an early age as he or she observes, collects, questions, compares and describes. An effective program develops this sense of curiosity, awe and wonder, interconnectedness and respect for the way all creation works together. At Dominic College, an exciting ‘hands on’ practical approach is integrated into all disciplines. Students are challenged to explore and question through experimental and investigative projects. As science affects all our lives, we include in programs examinations of the benefits to society and moral responsibility connected with scientific inventions. ‘Respect for life, and above all dignity of the human person, is the ultimate guiding norm for any sound economic, industrial or scientific development’ (Pope John Paul II).</p>
			<p>Students participate in a variety of external competitions which may include the Australian Titration Competition, The Australian Brain Bee Competition, Australian Science Competition or the National Chemistry Quiz. In elective courses, students may continue enrichment and research into such areas as Forensic, Antarctic and Marine Ecology or Ecological Stability. Students participate in field trips to venues such as CSIRO, the Marine Centre and industries around Hobart.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Physical Science</h1>
			<p>The Physical Sciences elective is a combination of both physics and chemistry taught with a focus on learning through student inquiry. The elective content is developed with reference to the TASC Level 3 Physical Science course to allow for academic extension. The inquiry approach to learning ensures flexibility to pursue individual interests through projects that can lead to a variety of science competitions and events, such as STEM MAD, UTAS Science and Engineering Investigation Awards, and the Festival of Bright Ideas. This helps to develop student autonomy in their learning and enhance creative and critical thinking skills.</p> 
			<p><i>It is highly recommended that a high aptitude in mathematics would benefit the prospective student.</i></p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Life Science</h1>
			<p>The Life Sciences elective is a combination of biology and ecosystems subject content, mirroring the Level 3 Life Science/Biology course to ensure that the transition from high school to college is not as challenging for students wanting to pursue this pathway. Neuroscience and function of the human brain is also a major focus and students participate in the Australian Brain Bee Challenge. </p> 
			<p>This course is useful for any students wishing to study Environmental Sciences, Antarctic Science, Nursing, Medicine and other Life Sciences such as Physiotherapy, Pharmacy and Sport Science. Biology also provides a good science knowledge base for careers in Education, Journalism and for general understanding of the processes of life.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Animal Husbandry</h1>
			<p>Animal Husbandry provides students with the opportunity to gain an understanding about the classification, anatomy, physiology behaviour and ethical care of a variety of animal species in society. Animal diversity, humane treatment and endangered animals will be some of the topics covered. Students will work with a variety of animals that are housed at the school; this will help support their learning.</p>
			<p>Who might be interested in Animal Husbandry? This subject would appeal to students interested in the natural sciences and to those who would like to broaden their understanding about a wide variety of animal species. Students interested in the environment, animal welfare and conservation issues should also be interested in this course. Students intending to do in Year 11 or Biology in Year 11 or 12 should also consider this elective.</p>
