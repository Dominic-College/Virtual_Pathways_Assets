			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Science Faculty Elective Information</h1>
			<p>In the words of Albert Einstein, ‘The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To think of new questions, new possibilities and to regard old problems from a different angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances.’</p>
			<p>Science is not just about learning a list of facts or understanding principles. Every child is a scientist from an early age as he or she observes, collects, questions, compares and describes. An effective program develops this sense of curiosity, awe and wonder, interconnectedness and respect for the way all creation works together. At Dominic College, an exciting ‘hands on’ practical approach is integrated into all disciplines. Students are challenged to explore and question through experimental and investigative projects. As science affects all our lives, we include in programs examinations of the benefits to society and moral responsibility connected with scientific inventions. ‘Respect for life, and above all dignity of the human person, is the ultimate guiding norm for any soundeconomic, industrial or scientific development’ (Pope John Paul II).</p>
			<p>Students participate in a variety of external competitions which may include the Australian Titration Competition, The Australian Brain Bee Competition, Australian Science Competition or the National Chemistry Quiz. In elective courses, students may continue enrichment and research into such areas as Forensic, Antarctic and Marine Ecology or Ecological Stability. Students participate in field trips to venues such as CSIRO, the Marine Centre and industries around Hobart.<i> The Marine Camp is only offered to Grade 10 students.</i></p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Physical Science</h1>
			<p>The Physical Sciences elective is a combination of both physics and chemistry subject content. The standard is similar to the Level 3 Physical Science course to allow for a smooth transition from high school to college. The course is useful for any students interested in engineering, health sciences, life sciences, human movement or any science degree. This elective also provides a good science knowledge base for careers in Science, Medicine, Education, Journalism and for general understanding of the workings of the physical world.</p> 
			<p>Pre-requisite: ‘B’ in Core Science.<br>It is highly recommended that a high aptitude in mathematics would benefit the prospective student.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Life Science</h1>
			<p>The Life Sciences elective is a combination of biology and ecosystems subject content, mirroring the Level 3 Life Science/Biology course to ensure that the transition from high school to college is not as challenging for students wanting to pursue this pathway. Neuroscience and function of the human brain is also a major focus and students participate in the Australian Brain Bee Challenge. </p> 
			<p>This course is useful for any students wishing to study Environmental Sciences, Antarctic Science, Nursing, Medicine and other Life Sciences such as Physiotherapy, Pharmacy and Sport Science. Biology also provides a good science knowledge base for careers in Education, Journalism and for general understanding of the processes of life.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Animal Husbandry and Marine Studies</h1>
			<p>Animal Husbandry provides students with the opportunity to gain an understanding about the classification, anatomy, physiology behaviour and ethical care of a variety of animal species in society. Animal diversity, humane treatment and endangered animals will be some of the topics covered. A unit on the marine habitat will culminate in a five day out-of-school Marine Studies Camp in Term 2.<i> This will apply to Year 10 students only.</i> Students will each have their own animal to help support their learning. Visiting off-campus locations allows further understanding of the role animals play in our life and society.</p>
