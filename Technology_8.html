			<p>English subjects communicate the knowledge and ideas that help students to make sense of their own lives and the world around them. They provide essential skills for the workforce and for tertiary studies.</p>
			<p>English is a core subject from Years 7-10 built around the three interrelated strands of Language, Literature and Literacy.</p>
			<p>Together the strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Students move from mastering the essentials of written expression to more sophisticated language use. There is a gradual increase in literature appreciation (novels, plays, poetry, short stories and film) over the four years to prepare students for English Studies in Years 11 and 12. Each student’s own writing is an important component in all year levels and they learn many techniques for improving the quality of their work. Speaking and listening skills are also developed.</p>
