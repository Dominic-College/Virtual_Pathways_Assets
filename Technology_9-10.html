			<p>The Department of Technology and Applied Studies offers Information Technology, Food Technology and Design and Technology to all year levels and Introduction to Vocational Education and Training subjects for Year 10 (Guilford Young College RTO No.1129). In Year 7 students are presented with these subjects as an essential elective to give them a basic introduction. Through this experience they can make an informed judgement as to whether they pursue one or more of the Technology and Applied Studies subjects in Years 8, 9 and 10. The experiences inherent in design and problem-solving in the use of technologies can be applied across the curriculum.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Information Technology</h1>
			<p>Each Year 9 and 10 course has a strong practical focus where students develop skills in programming and the use of a number of different types of software. These skills are then applied in culminating and authentic real-world projects. Students are encouraged to develop the ability to work independently to solve problems and find appropriate solutions using the resources they have available. There is a strong focus on developing an understanding of data security and algorithms.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Computer Graphics and Design</h1>
			<p>This is a one year course that can be studied in either Year 9 or Year 10. Students will have the opportunity to undertake two strands in this subject to cover the two key aspects of Design Graphics as described below:</p>
            <h3>Strand Descriptor – Design Graphics</h3>
			<p>This syllabus offers students the opportunity to communicate complex knowledge and ideas and solve detailed problems in a graphic form. It provides for self-expression through the use of diverse drawing techniques, materials and processes. Students apply advanced skills in interpreting and designing complex drawings.</p>
            <h3>Strand Descriptor – Computer Graphics</h3>
            <p>In this syllabus the students will be introduced to various computer graphic applications and industry standard software and will explore the development of computer graphics and look at its future direction. The design component of the course aims to develop the student’s ability to solve problems in design and graphics communication and to help them appreciate the role graphics plays in information technology.</p>
