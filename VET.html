			<h1 class="heading h-gold">VET Course Information</h1>
			<p>Dominic College is a member of the Consortium of Catholic Schools which have been granted funding for the development of a Trade Training Centre. Year 10 students at Dominic College now have access to accredited VET units. This project is aimed at addressing the skills shortages in our community. This project also allows us to strengthen our links with industry and local business. Students who take up this opportunity for skill based training will be able to gain qualifications while at school and college and then will be able to transition from college straight into apprenticeships. GYC is the Registered Training Organisation (Guilford Young College RTO No.1129) and these qualifications are recognised Australia-wide. Students wishing to do a VET course will be required to participate in an application and interview process to gain a place in this course. This is a relatively informal process, giving students the opportunity to articulate their reason for choosing to do a VET course and their commitment to the course.</p>

			<h1 class="heading h-gold">Introduction to Construction</h1>
			<p>This program provides an introduction to the construction industry, its culture, occupations, job roles and workplace expectations. The units of competency cover essential workplace health and safety requirements, the industrial and work organisation structure, communication skills, work planning, and basic use of tools and materials. The qualification is built around a basic construction project unit that integrates the skills and embeds the facets of employability skills. This course is offered to students in Year 10 only. It is recommended that students in Year 9 who are considering introduction to VET options should choose the Design in Wood elective in Year 9 as this has been developed to provide preparatory skills which will be needed when undertaking an Introduction to Construction (VET) course in Year 10.</p> 
			<p>This course provides a pathway to future study in Certificate I and II in Construction, Certificate III in Construction and Certificate IV in Building and Construction and many other Construction, Plumbing or Allied Trades VET courses.</p>
